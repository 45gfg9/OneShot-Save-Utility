# OneShot Save Utility
#### You only have one or more shots.

A tool to manage save files for the game [OneShot](http://oneshot-game.com).

## Features

* Easily save and restore save points anywhere in the game!
* Change your player name without restarting!

## Get

[Download it here!](https://github.com/hunternet93/OneShot-Save-Utility/releases/)

## Usage

After downloading, just fire it up! Create save points by setting a name and clicking "save", restore saves by choosing them from the list and clicking "load". Name changes are just as easy.

## Future features

* Linux and MacOS support -- Should be trivial once OneShot is released on those platforms
* Tweaking other game settings -- Change the recorded number of playthroughs, or change the version of a certain character shown (Spoiler!)

To run OneShot Save Utility from source you'll need [Python](https://python.org), [PSUtil](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/psutil), and [rubymarshal](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rubymarshal).
